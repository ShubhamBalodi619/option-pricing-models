# Option Pricing â€“ Black-Scholes Model

This project implements the **Black-Scholes formula** to calculate the theoretical price of European-style **call and put options** using Python.

It assumes log-normally distributed stock prices and uses an analytical approach based on market inputs like volatility, time to maturity, and risk-free rate.

## ðŸ“Œ Model Assumptions

- Markets are frictionless and arbitrage-free  
- The stock does not pay dividends  
- Volatility and interest rates are constant  
- Stock returns are normally distributed  
- European-style options (exercisable only at expiration)

---

## ðŸ§® Methodology

- Accepts the following input parameters:
  - **St**: Current stock price  
  - **K**: Strike price  
  - **T**: Time to maturity (in years)  
  - **Rf**: Risk-free rate of return  
  - **vol**: Annualized volatility  
  - **opttype**: Option type â€“ `"c"` for call, `"p"` for put  
- Computes intermediate variables `d1` and `d2`  
- Calculates the option price using the Black-Scholes formula:
  - Call Option: `C = SÂ·N(d1) âˆ’ KÂ·e^(âˆ’rT)Â·N(d2)`  
  - Put Option: `P = KÂ·e^(âˆ’rT)Â·N(âˆ’d2) âˆ’ SÂ·N(âˆ’d1)`
